# Handheld-Raman-Nitrate-Investigation
Examining how different algorithms (PCA and RVM) perform on different Raman instruments in differentiating between
magnesium nitrate and calcium nitrate samples. Currently, the 785 nm device can differentiate the samples properly using its PCA algorithm, but the 1064 nm device cannot distinguish the samples using its RVM algorithm and the goal is to uncover the reason behind this 
phenomenon.
